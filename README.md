# Learn Node.js by Building 6 Projects
This is the code repository for [Learn Node.js by Building 6 Projects](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/learn-nodejs-building-6-projects?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788293631), published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
##Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
http.createServer(function(req, res) {
  var uri = url.parse(req.url).pathname;
  var fileName = path.join(process.cwd(), unescape(uri));
  console.log('Loading'+uri);
  var stats;
});
```

With its event-driven architecture and efficient web services capabilities, more and more companies are building their entire infrastructure around Node.js. Node has become a de facto part of web development that any serious developer needs to master.

This book includes six Node.js projects that gradually increase in complexity. You'll start by building a simple web server and create a basic website. You will then move to create the login system, blog system, chat system, and e-learning system.

By creating and following the example projects in this book, youâ€™ll improve your Node.js skills through practical working projects, and you'll learn how to use Node.js with many other useful technologies, such as ExpressJS, Kickstart, and Heroku.
